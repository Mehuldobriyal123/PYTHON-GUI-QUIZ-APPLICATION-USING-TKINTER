# PYTHON-GUI-QUIZ-APPLICATION-USING-TKINTER

Problem statement:-
-> We will be developing a simple multiple-choice quiz in python with GUI using Tkinter. 
-> This is a standard quiz application that presents a set of carefully curated questions to the users (a questionnaire), allows them to 
   answer the same, and displays the correct answer if they are wrong. 
-> Each test will display the final score of the user. 
-> The application will have an account creation option, wherein some users can be appointed as Admins
